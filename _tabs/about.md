Hi there, I'm KitoKotowa, you can call me Kiet instead âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨. I'm currently a Computer Science student at VNU-HCM University of Science (or HCMUS for short)

My main focuses are Data Science and AI, but I'm open to something related to Big Data as well (slowly improving...) ðŸ˜µ

Currently trying really hard on [Elden Ring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/) and vibing with [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/) whenever I'm free, I also love souls/indie games like [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1) or [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/) for a little adrenaline boost  (Guess I'm a masochist eh?) ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿
